		focus on eating food pellets, and can also strategize in a team setting
		(the tournament variant). This project series was an application of various
		concepts taught in the course Artificial Intelligence such heuristic based
		A* search, Reflex agent dynamics, Q-learning, etc.

		Developed a small tool in python to download multimedia files over a TCP connection given a list of servers
		(peers) that have a copy. The file was logically split into chunks, each chunk was fetched from a server
		dynamically based on speeds and latency of them. The download was spread over multiple threads for efficiency,
		the tool was resilient to disconnections and resumed on reconnection.

			The game is designed to teach players about firewall concepts with each
			levels having basic networking concepts. The goal is to teach simple
			commands and syntax of iptables which includes basic commands of adding
			rules to a firewall and understanding the use of chains. The Player in an
			administrator’s role sets up the firewall rules. Defense against various
			types of attacks; such as DOS attack, DDOS attack, IP Spoofing attack, etc.
			is taught through game play.
